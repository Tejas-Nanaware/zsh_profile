# Introduction
Use this repository to change your zsh profile in your Mac. There are some lazy commands that I often use, such as `gst` instead of `git status`.

# Preview
Here is how the terminal looks like.

# Installation
To install, clone the repo, open the `Solarized Dark.terminal` file and go to preferences to make it as default.  
Copy the contents from `repo/.zshrc` to `~/.zshrc`.  
Copy the contents from `repo/.gitconfig` to `~/.gitconfig`.  
Copy the file from `repo/.gitexcludes` to `~/`.  
Restart the terminal.
